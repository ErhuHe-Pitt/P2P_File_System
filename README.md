# P2P file sharing system

### Overview
We implemented a P2P file-sharing system with a specialized indexing server using Java. Our system provides two types of downloading services, respectively SINGLE and CHUNK. The first design allows peers to download a file from only one peer. On the other hand, the second design allows peers to download a file from multiple users (up to five) as chunks.
